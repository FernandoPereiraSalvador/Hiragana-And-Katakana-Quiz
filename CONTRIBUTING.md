## Contribution Guide for Hiragana and Katakana Quiz
## Get Started

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! Any contribution you make will be reflected on [github.com](https://github.com/FernandoPereiraSalvador/Hiragana-And-Katakana-Quiz) :sparkles:.

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community accessible and respectful.

In this guide, you will get an overview of the contribution flow, from opening an issue, creating a pull request, reviewing and merging the pull request.

- Configuring Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you find a problem in the documentation, [check if a related issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments). If no related issue exists, you can open a new one using a relevant issue form [here](https://github.com/FernandoPereiraSalvador/Hiragana-And-Katakana-Quiz/issues/new/choose).

#### Resolving an issue

Take a look at our [existing issues](https://github.com/FernandoPereiraSalvador/Hiragana-And-Katakana-Quiz/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow your search by using `labels` as filters. As a general rule, we do not assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue you want to work on, you can open a pull request (PR) with the solution.

### Make Changes

#### Make changes to the user interface (UI)

Click **Make a Contribution** at the bottom of any documentation page to make small changes, such as correcting a spelling mistake, fixing a sentence, or correcting a broken link. This will take you to the `.md` file where you can make the changes and [create a pull-request](#pull-request) for review.

#### Making changes in a development environment

For more information on using a development environment to work on GitHub documentation, see "[Working in a development environment](https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/contributing/codespace.md)."

#### Make changes locally

1. Make a fork of the repository.
   - Using GitHub Desktop:
     - [Introduction to GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/getting-started-with-github-desktop) will walk you through setting up Desktop.
     - Once Desktop is set up, you can use it to [make a fork of the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/cloning-and-forking-repositories-from-github-desktop)!

   - Using the command line:
     - [make a repository fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you are ready to merge them.

2. Install or upgrade to **Node.js**, in the version specified in `.node-version`.

3. Create a working branch and start your changes.

### Commit your changes

Commit your changes once you are satisfied with them. Don't forget to check your own work to speed up the review process :zap:.

### Extraction Request

When you are finished with your changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Complete the "Ready for Review" template so we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes and the purpose of your pull request.
- Don't forget to [link the PR to the issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) if you are resolving one.
- Check the box to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so that the branch can be updated for merging.
Once you submit your PR, a member of the documentation team will review it. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may request changes before we can merge a PR, either via [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or comments in the extract request. You can apply suggested changes directly through the user interface. You can make any other changes in your fork and then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you encounter problems when merging, check out this [Git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.
