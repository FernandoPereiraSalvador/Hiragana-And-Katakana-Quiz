## Summary

The Hiragana and Katakana Quiz is an exciting app designed to learn the Japanese writing systems, Hiragana and Katakana, in a fun and interactive way. This game offers two unique game modes:

- **Japanese to Spanish:** In this mode, a Japanese character is presented and challenges the player to enter its Spanish equivalent. It is an excellent way to learn the correspondence between Japanese characters and their meaning in Spanish.

- **Spanish to Japanese:** In this mode, the player sees a character in Spanish and must select the correct option among three possible ones in Japanese. This helps reinforce visual recognition and reverse translation of characters.

In addition to these exciting game modes, users have the freedom to choose which alphabet characters they want to practice, allowing for a highly personalized learning experience.

But that is not all. The app also offers a player progress tracking feature. Generates graphs that show user progress over time and highlight areas where they may need improvement. This encourages motivation and constant learning.
